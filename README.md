# High-throughput_DFT_Multinode_OneJobPerNodes
This repository provides a pipeline for high-throughput DFT calculations using multinode parallelization, where each node runs a single job. It includes automated job splitting, SLURM submission scripts, and Psi4-based quantum chemistry calculations, optimized for efficient resource allocation and scalability across multiple nodes.
